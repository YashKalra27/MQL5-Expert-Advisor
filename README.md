## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Signal Generation** — Trades are triggered by custom-coded EMA crossover logic and other filters.
2. **Risk Management** — Position size, Stop Loss, and Take Profit levels auto-scale as a percentage of total capital and asset value.
3. **King of Trailing SL** — The moment a position goes profitable, an ultra-tight trailing stop locks in gains, resulting in a consistently high win rate.
4. **Fully Automated Execution** — The EA runs on MetaTrader 5 with no manual oversight required — removing human bias entirely.
